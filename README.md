# ID2223-Scalable Machine Learning

This repository contains the labs and the final project that I did for the course *Scalable Machine Learning* at KTH.
It has the following structure:

* labs/lab1 : This folder is about the first labwork of the course, analysis of credit crad defaults using Spark.
* labs/lab2 : This folder is about the second labwork of the course, implementation based of scientific papers, of the [Inception](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf) and [Show and Tell](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) neural networks, using TensorFlow 2.0.
* project : This folder is about the final project of the course, that I chose to do about the generation of clickbait titles using a LSTM (see project proposal and report).
